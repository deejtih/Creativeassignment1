Task 1: Summary
	The following data we are taking is named “CDPH environmental complaints”. It was first created in 2012 and was last updated in September 2023. The set contains data dating back from January 1993 and was collected by the Department of Environment from 1993 to 2011. The DOE then disbanded in 2012  and transferred all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities to the Department of Public Health. The data is organized by “Complaint types” which include issues related to site abandonment, air pollution, and construction just to name a few. Each complaint type is linked with an attribute which includes: the complaint ID, location of the complaint, the date it was received, specific details of the complaint, its data source, and the ID and narrative log of the inspector who conducted the complaint inspection. As of today, the data contains over 57,0000 complaints to analyze. The data presents itself to be useful to people who wish to live in the area the data is collected from. It will also prove useful to anyone looking to start a business designed for tourists or customers such as a restaurant, hotel, mall, etc. It can also be potentially used as a tool to help the city or engineers who seek to find ways to improve the quality of life in certain areas.

Task 2: Domain Quations
	The first question we have is “Why are the majority of complaints coming from 2701 E 100TH ST?”. The data chart has an attribute labeled as “addresses,” which is the area where the complaint has originated from. The table contains over hundreds of addresses, yet 2701 E holds the most complaints by a large margin. Our group has become curious as to what makes this address so special and we wish to discover what disturbance they suffer the most from. Exploring this question can help us figure out if living in 2701 E is ideal and perhaps figure out a way to reduce their number of complaints.
Another question that has come up is, “Does the undivided amount of confirmed inspections lead to inaccuracy?”. Another attribute the table contains are inspector IDs which identifies the person who investigated the complaint to confirm its legitimacy. We have discovered that certain inspectors such as number 9 make up almost 8% of total confirmed inspections while the rest fall on average under 5%. What was also surprising is that number 9’s most frequent complaint area is not even 2701 E 100TH ST (which has the highest number of complaints). There are over hundreds of inspectors and we feel that due to their large number, there could be a chance that there is an inaccuracy of confirmations. This is why we feel there is an importance of investigating this question.
Our next question is “What factors led to the increase in air pollution in 2021, which was also the same time with the most complaints?”. The attributes that are associated with this would be complaint type and the complaint date. Looking at a time line of the data, we can see there is a jump in data during 2021 where the highest value is air pollution. We can analyze what had happened during this time with air quality to find out what could have caused this, and look forward to preventing this many complaints in the future. 
The fourth question is “Why is the complaint type ‘Air Pollution Work Order’ associated with 21,841 complaints, by far the highest complaint type?”. The attribute associated with this question is the “complaint type” column. There are 25 distinct types of complaints however “air pollution work order” exceeds the second most complaints “noise complaint” by 14,000 complaints. We as a team can analyze this data and identify the reasoning for the large number of complaints, simplified to just one specific data attribute. Additionally, identifying the large number of complaints allows for further analysis such as identifying a potential solution for the complaints. 
Finally, we will ask “What factors contribute to the high number of complaints originating from the 16 boundary zip code in Chicago?”. The attributes associated with this domain question are the count of complaint id, that is to count each individual complaint, and secondly the boundaries of zip codes. The 16 boundary zip code amasses a total of 2,700 unique complaints. This data set is unique as the 16 boundary zip code resides with Irving Park, the northwest side of Chicago. This allows us to analyze and identify what causes such a high number of complaints from this area. In contrast, we can compare these findings with that of boundary zip code 6 which only has a total of 6 complaints. We can formulate an understanding on the vast difference of complaints and hypothesis potential solutions. 

Task 3: Task abstractions
	To transform our first domain question into abstraction tasks, we must first identify the complaint types 2701 E is suffering from the most. This will help us get a general idea of what kind of complaints they give out the most. From there we can analyze if the complaints contain some sort of trend by exploring their “details” (another attribute of the data set). Finally, we can compare its complaints with other addresses who suffer from similar experiences. This will help us discover what could make 2701 E different.
To transform the second question we need to identify the locations the top 5 inspectors look into. This will help us get a general idea of what areas have a dedicated inspector vs a variety of inspectors. Next we should analyze what type of complaint the inspectors are investigating, it is important to note that the inspectors are also engineers so it could be possible that they are sending certain inspectors into specific complaints. This will help confirm if our hypothesis is correct. Finally, we need to compare their logs to see the details of what they have confirmed. This will point out if there are any unmatched findings for inspectors who visited the same area.
To transform the third domain question into abstraction tasks, we need to figure out why there was an influx of reports and why so many of them were about air pollution. We can compare this data to other years to figure out what was special about this year or what was different.
For the fourth question, investigating the contributing factors to the large number of “air pollution work order” complaints at 21,841 allows us to identify why these complaints are occurring and at specific locations. Utilizing additional attributes such as complaint details allows us to analyze the data and compare to other locations that allows for the identification of anomalies. 
Finally for the last question, investigate the large number of complaints stemming from boundary zip code 16 and formulate reasoning to the large number. Utilize other low count zip code areas to compare and contrast. Creating sketches and demonstrating the high volume of complaints allows us to take the next step for identifying solutions. 

Task 4: Sketches [NOTE THAT WE DISPLAY IMAGE FIRST, PARAGRAPH SECOND]

This sketch focuses on looking at all the complaint types 2701 E St has filed and comparing that number with other addresses. It contains two sets with the second graph only appearing after a clicking interaction with the first set. The first graph is a pie chart of all the complaint types 2701 E has made, it is visually colored and has a legend of what each color represents. The second graph is a bar chart with a number of complaints for the y-axis and the names of other addresses for the x-axis. It is organized in descending order and set to have a limit to the total number of complaints of the selected complaint type for 2701 E. The user is first presented with the pie graph,  the user is then able to select a complaint type (let's say they select ‘air pollution’ which has a total of 300 complaints filed), from there the second graph will be displayed with a limit on the y-axis to 300. I wanted to display all of the complaint types 2701 E St has made and I felt like a pie chart was the best approach. My reason is that I believe a bar chart was the fastest way to show the variety and magnitude of complaints. I also felt that a descending bar chart was the most effective way to visually compare 2701 E’s complaints with other addresses as it is easy to understand.

This sketch has the same focus on the first one but goes into further detail of what was reported from the inspectors point of view. Similarly, it contains two sets with the second graph only appearing after a clicking interaction with the first set. The first graph is a grouped bar chart with the number of complaints on the y-axis and the complaint types on the x-axis. It is stacked by addresses each having its own color along with having a legend. The second graph is like a bar/ scatter plot hybrid with the inspector ID for the y-axis and the complaint date reported on the x-axis. Each dot on the scatter plot has an interaction in which if you hover over it, an inspector's log will appear. The user is presented with the stacked chart first, they are then able to click on a street they want to inspect and from there the scatter chart is presented. I felt that a stacked bar chart was the best way to visually present all the streets at once and demonstrate just how large the number of complaints 2701 E has compared to the others. The reason behind the scatter/ bar chart hybrid was because it is able to visually present how many reports each inspector has done relative to the complaint. The dots also help make an easy interaction to inspect each report individually.

My final sketch is like a mash-up of the first two sketches in terms of presentation and goals. In total there will be 3 graphs but the first two are shown together as a multi-view. The map we see on the left is the area where the data was collected. On the top, the user is able to select a specific address they want to focus on . From there the map changes and displays your selected address on the map. The second graph is a pi chart displaying all the complaint types related to your selected address along with a legend. The user then has the ability that if they hover over any part of the pie chart categories, the map would display the location of other complaints of the same type throughout the map. From there, the user is able to click on their desired complaint type and a third graph of the same bar/scatter plot hybrid from sketch two appears. I believe the multi-view of the map and pie chart is a great way for the user to visually see and compare the other areas who suffer the same complaint.

The following sketches will focus on analyzing the inspectors. The goal of sketch 4 is to show each individual inspector and visually represent the amount of reports that they have investigated along with going into detail of their findings.  Sketch 4 has two data sets with the second one only showing after a clicking interaction. The first data set highlights the number of complaints per inspector with the number of complaints investigated for the y-axis and inspector ID on the x-axis. There is a button on the right side giving the user the ability to how they want to order the visual data. Upon clicking a bar the user wants to investigate they are greeted to a bar/scatter plot related to the inspector's ID in a multi-view format. This is a design similar to sketch 2 and 3 but has the complaint type instead for its y-axis. However, functionality wise it is the same (you hover over a dot to get a detailed log). I felt like this display of visualization is a very easy way for the user to understand as its minimalistic design keeps things simple.

![Alex_Sketch5](https://github.com/uic-cs424/assignment-1-creative-ana-lit-ics/assets/122648966/48c51d49-eeda-4c52-9ff2-b6adde23bd2a)
This sketch fully focuses on the comparison between two inspectors. The user is given a donut graph containing the inspectors with the most inspections (probably top 10). Each inspector ID is color coded and a legend corresponding to their color. The user is able to select one inspector they want to focus on, from there the graph changes as it removes your selected inspector. Next, you are able to choose a second inspector you want to compare After selecting, a side by side bar chart will display showing you first choice on the left and second choice on the right. The type of complaint will be the y-axis and number of inspections will be the x-axis. I felt like this approach (especially the side by side bar charts) is the best way to compare two sets of data. While I did want to add a way to visually compare both inspectors inspection logs, I felt like it would not work out too well with this design approach as it will be too much for the user to look at.

![Alex_Sketch6](https://github.com/uic-cs424/assignment-1-creative-ana-lit-ics/assets/122648966/8d82f6b9-8a2a-47ca-b1d5-0a8f5f2b9024)
The final sketch takes inspirations from sketch 5 and sketch 3 with the goal of displaying how much area each inspector covers throughout chicago land. The user is given two graphs displayed in a multiview fashion. The first set shows all categories of complaint type presented as donut graphs. Each graph contains the top 4 inspectors that dominate that category with every inspector having their own color code with a legend. To the right to the graphs there is an empty map. The user is then able to click a complaint type they want to investigate, doing so will fill the map with colored marks representing each inspector. The pink star appears when more than one inspector has investigated the same area. I felt like this design approach was the fastest way for the user to do everything all at once. It also gives them the ability to explore the map in several different ways. While I am satisfied with the design, I feel that it might be a little too much information to look at for some users. I must also state that the reason donut charts only contain top 4 inspectors is because adding any more would actually be too much for someone to look at.

My sketch focuses on what impact does the direction of the address have on the data. When sketching my data, I looked at the number of reports per year at first, this was to give an overview of the data, and see how looked. Then I sketched the four directions in different colors over time to show that there was a meaningful difference between the different attributes. When looking at the graph, I feel it isn’t very clear that one has more complaints than the other. This is why I moved onto my second sketch.

![Deejith_sketch2](https://github.com/uic-cs424/assignment-1-creative-ana-lit-ics/assets/122648966/516236c1-13ea-47a0-bf90-a2dd1d27de8c)
I made a map of the Chicago land area, and highlighted the areas considered N, E, S, W while showing the intersection of some of the data. I did East and West separately than North and South as I did not want to clutter the data.  I also added a simple bar chart on the side, to show how the West has the greatest number of complaints. This paired with the map might reveal why this is the case. I believe I should have picked better colors as it is not easy to look at.

![Deejith_sketch3](https://github.com/uic-cs424/assignment-1-creative-ana-lit-ics/assets/122648966/ec90ba86-f278-4631-95d4-964924b7d5ff)
I then made a pie chart with the different directions, I tried to create a snaky graph to show the types of complaints per direction. I believe this was a good idea as it shows the contrast between the different complaint types compared to the direction, and which type was most prominent. I think I could have made this cleaner, but as a sketch I feel it delivers the message I am trying to send, in the future I would like to use a bigger sheet of paper and learn how to make the snaky chart look cleaner.

This sketch focuses on what complaint type has the biggest impact in the data. The first Sketch I did for this was two charts layered on top of each other, a bar chart and a line chart. Both having time as an x-axis and both having number of reports as the Y-axis. What separated them was the bar chart showed all reports per year over time while the line graph showed just the air pollution. This showed the big increase of air Pollution during 2021. Air pollution was chosen as it had the highest overall number of complaints.  I wanted to put the line onto the bar-chart to show that they are related more but I scaled the graph too close together making it hard to do so.

![Deejith_sketch5](https://github.com/uic-cs424/assignment-1-creative-ana-lit-ics/assets/122648966/d84e1c09-7779-4297-a883-cb105ca09746)
I then created a waffle chart to show the different categories of complaints. I chose waffle as it would show which one has the most and it is easier to read than a pie chart. One this that I would improve on this would be to have more straight lines as it makes the boxes seem like they are not even. This could cause confusion as to the values of each box, the color choices were hard to choose too as there was a limited selection.

The following sketches focuses on why is the complaint type “Air Pollution Work Order” associated with 21,841 complaints, by far the highest complaint type. The main idea of detailing a Sankey diagram was to showcase the large number of air pollution work order complaints in relation to the other type of complaints. With only 12 distinct complaint types, it was essential to visual a sketch minimizing the types to maximize the vast difference in totals between complaint types. Specifically in this visualized sketch, it can be seen by how far air pollution work orders complaints lead other types of complaints, allowing us to visualize the question, “Why is air pollution work orders by far the largest type of complaint?” This sketch worked out incredibly well because the visualization allows us to see the vast difference. The associated attribute with this sketch is the total counts of each complaint type.

![Miguel_sketch2](https://github.com/uic-cs424/assignment-1-creative-ana-lit-ics/assets/122648966/bd933885-ad02-400c-886f-8925967bbb34)
The motivation for this sketch was to showcase a clear visual of the data that represents the vast difference between each attribute and complaint types. The visual representation allows the user to understand and conclude the high number of complaints for air pollution in comparison to the other types of complaints. What worked well with this sketch was the space efficiency and simplicity of the data to be represented visually. Additionally, it is easy to interpret.

![Miguel_sketch3](https://github.com/uic-cs424/assignment-1-creative-ana-lit-ics/assets/122648966/8a49af0b-b77d-46dc-ad1b-5a2b34c94342)
The following sketches focuses on what factors contribute to the high number of complaints originating from the 16 boundary zip code in Chicago. The main idea of this sketch was to showcase the high concentration of complaints arising from boundary zip code communities in Chicago. My question arises from why the highest complaints arise from boundary 16. The heat map breaks down the city of Chicago based on one attribute: boundary community areas and their zip codes. After sketching, it showcases a high concentration arising from 16 with over 2500 complaints. This sticks out like a sore thumb because the neighboring boundary zip code communities each hold less than 1500 complaints. This sketch allows us to dissect and hypothesize the large number of complaints. Furthermore, investigating the surrounding communities allows for solutions to rise to assist boundary 16 with the significant complaints. 

![Miguel_sketch4](https://github.com/uic-cs424/assignment-1-creative-ana-lit-ics/assets/122648966/5d0e8edf-a00f-49e0-bf2e-9c5c116eb3e2)
The stacked bar chart diagram is essential for the investigation of this question. The attributes utilized to create this sketch are total complaints and boundaries – zip code (wards). Additionally, each bar is broken further down into types of complaint. This is critical because it showcases exactly why there is such a large number of complaints arising from the 16-boundary ward. Furthermore, with the breakdown by complaint type, it allows us to identify solutions to the high volume of complaints. 

![Miguel_sketch5](https://github.com/uic-cs424/assignment-1-creative-ana-lit-ics/assets/122648966/572380b8-0b40-4aba-bc81-2a40bdb85e74)
The final double line sketch showcases the 16-boundary ward and its six bordering boundary wards. In addition to this attribute, it showcases the total amount of complaints for each boundary ward along with the total number of air pollution complaints. Hence, the need for two lines. This sketch allows us to visual both questions above: why many air pollution complaints in addition to the high volume of complaints are there so arising from the 16 boundary ward. This allows us to investigate each discussion and summarize potential solutions. 

Task 5: Summary
	We believe that everyone has worked really hard on creating their sketches. During the project we realized that creating multiple sketches for one question was a little challenging which is why we ended up having 6 domain questions in total. We noticed that all of us have implemented color at least one time into our drawings as we agreed that color is perhaps one of the most effective ways to display data. Perhaps our biggest strength in our graph was how well each display represents the magnitude of categorical data we are trying to represent which include complaint types, IDs, addresses, etc. However, a weakness we have noticed is that some of our graphs can’t beautifully display data properly if it contains too much information. This explains why some of our graphs have a limited number of attributes. In terms of creativity we believe we all did good, while some of us have repeated some graphs such as a bar chart, we believe its functionality, interactions, and overall goal it is trying to achieve are different enough to make them unique.
